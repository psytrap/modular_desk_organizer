# Build

Bill of material

2x2 A4 + 2x Seperator
5x A6 + Spacer
1x A6 Topbox + Ramp
2x Drawer
1x Pencil holder
2x Paint assist
=> 14x cut, maybe an extra A6 box as experimental sample
1x Paint base - better a solid wood board


Acryl Paint + 20% Water -> until fluid, cardboard will suck it up
11x Black back but not the top box
Distribute color with Pencil in all directions
Dry a day
Freshly painted cardboards can be place on old news papers

Build boxes, mind the lashes
When cutting the large boxes use the guide markers if you want to place separators
Fingergrip is tricky, carefully remove the top layer, puncture the bottom layer with needles or a flat screwdriver then do the cut 

Attach Seperator to A4
Build all boxes

Build two paint assist use for painting while one has it's inital dry phase
Completely paint the inner of top box let it dry and after the other boxes are done, start with the outer surfaces
on paint assist start with the edges then fill the areas

Glue things together
If you have poorly painted boxes, use them as inner elements
